![AutoAttend Logo](https://github.com/Arpit483/exp2/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/immigration.png)

## Overview

AutoAttend is an AI-powered attendance management system that uses facial recognition to automate and streamline the process of tracking student attendance. Traditional methods are time-consuming and error-prone, often allowing proxy entries and inaccurate records. AutoAttend ensures real-time detection, high accuracy, and secure data logging.
